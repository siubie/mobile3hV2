Android Basic XML Layouts

Containers
    LinearLayout  is the most common modeling tool. It offers a "box" model similar to the Java-Swing  Box-Layout. 
Summary of Commonly-used Android containers  

    1. LinearLayout (the box model), 
            indicates whether the LinearLayout represents a row or a column. Add the android:orientation property to 
        your LinearLayout element in your XML layout, setting the value to be horizontal for a row or vertical for a 
        column. The orientation can be modified at runtime by invoking setOrientation().

    2. RelativeLayout (a rule-based model),
            RelativeLayout places widgets based on their relationship to other widgets in the container and the parent
        container. 

    3. TableLayout (the grid model), along with 
            Android's TableLayout allows you to position your widgets in a grid made of identifiable rows and columns.
        Columns might shrink or stretch to accommodate their contents. TableLayout works in conjunction with TableRow. 
        TableLayout controls the overall behavior of the container, with the widgets themselves positioned into one or 
        more TableRow containers, one per row in the grid.

    4. ScrollView, 
            a container designed to assist with implementing scrolling containers. When we have more data than what can
        be shown on a single screen you may use the ScrollView control.It provides a sliding or scrolling access to the
        data. This way the user can only see part of your layout at one time, but the rest is available via scrolling.
        This is similar to browsing a large web page that forces the userto scroll up the page to see the bottom part of
        the form.

    5. Miscellaneous Absolute Layout
            A layout that lets you specify exact locations (x/y coordinates) of its children. Absolute layouts are less
        flexible and harder to maintain than other types of layouts without absolute positioning. 

Android’s simplest layout manager is called: Frame Layout, a Frame Layout is a rectangular container that pins each 
child to its upper left corner.Adding multiple views to a frame layout just stacks one on top of the other (over
lapping the views)
