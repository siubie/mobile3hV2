Today we will continue on the a APLAS models. I'm going to work on B4 and continue my progress. 
B4 is another basic app to create an android application that contains several activities entitled Animal Tour. 
First with project configuration and resource configuration. In today's lesson we will learn about widgets.
Widgets enable users to interact with an Android Studio application page. 
There are various kinds of widgets, such as Buttons and TextViews.
To create another widget, we simply drag and drop the desired widget onto the desired location on the Android application page or write the code for it in the XML file.
There are two components of each Android activity: the XML (Extensible Markup Language) design (the beauty) and the Java text (the brains).
On the activity_main.xml page, you can see the full widgets palette underneath the various layout options.
There are many more widgets to use; learning to use various widgets can help to create more complete, user-friendly applications.
